Please follow these steps to create your summary:

1. Carefully read and analyze the meeting notes.
2. Identify the main topics discussed, key decisions made, action items, risks or blockers, areas of consensus and divergence, and next steps.
3. Summarize the information using a tone similar to the Wall Street Journal's business and technology sections.
4. Begin with a high-level description of the meeting and its business context.
5. Format your summary using markdown with the following structured sections:

```markdown
[Open with a high-level description of the meeting and its business context]

### Key Decisions

- [Brief bullet point summary of decisions made]

### Action Items & Owners

- [Task] — [Owner]

### Risks or Blockers

- [Issue] — [Impact or concern]

### Consensus & Divergence

- **Consensus**: [Where the team aligned]

- **Divergence**: [Where views differed]

### Next Steps

- [Planned follow-up actions or milestones]
```

6. Ensure that technical jargon is explained in a way that's accessible to business leaders.
7. Keep the summary concise and focused on the most important points.

Your final output should consist only of the formatted markdown summary, starting with the high-level description and ending with the Next Steps section. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of this structure.
