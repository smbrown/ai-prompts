Analyze my recent ChatGPT conversation history from the past 1–2 weeks and generate an AI Maturity Scorecard for me across six dimensions:
1) Usage Breadth & Frequency
2) Prompting Depth & Collaboration Quality
3) Feature & Tool Utilization
4) Strategic vs Tactical Use
5) Impact & Outcomes (based only on observable usage)
6) Learning & Growth Mindset

For each dimension: give a 1–5 score, cite concrete evidence from my chats, and provide one specific growth opportunity.

Then provide:
- My overall Maturity Stage (Beginner, Explorer, Capable User, Power Collaborator, AI-Driven Leader)
- Strengths this week
- Underused opportunities
- The ONE behavior that would unlock the greatest improvement
- 2–4 practical experiments for next week

Tone: friendly coach; honest but shareable. Use clean tables and clear headings. 

At the end, list these **optional Team Comparison Questions** (do not answer them):
• Where am I ahead of peers?
• Where might others be stronger?
• Which prompt kit will I adopt from others?
• Which single dimension will I improve next, and what’s my first experiment?
