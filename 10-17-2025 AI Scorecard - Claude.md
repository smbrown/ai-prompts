# AI Maturity Scorecard - October 2025

## Scoring Rubric
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Beginner: Limited, occasional use with basic approaches |
| 2 | Explorer: Regular use but with simple techniques |
| 3 | Capable User: Consistent use with growing sophistication |
| 4 | Power Collaborator: Strategic, creative use with advanced techniques |
| 5 | AI-Driven Leader: Transformative, innovative approaches that change workflows |

## Dimension Scoring

### 1. Usage Breadth & Frequency
**Score: 4/5**

**Evidence:**
- Regularly uses multiple AI tools including Claude, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Gemini, and M365 Copilot
- Applies AI across professional domains (IT management, software development, process creation) and personal needs (travel planning, cycling)
- Uses AI tools consistently for varied tasks from technical (database analysis, coding) to creative (content development, communication drafting)

**Growth Opportunity:** Consider establishing a weekly "AI experimentation hour" to systematically try new use cases beyond your current comfort zones.

### 2. Prompting Depth & Collaboration Quality
**Score: 4/5**

**Evidence:**
- Creates detailed, contextual prompts with clear constraints (IT role definition, SharePoint access explanation)
- Iteratively refines outputs through follow-up questions and clarifications
- Provides detailed information when needed and shares existing content for AI to improve (response to SharePoint admin request)
- Uses AI as a thought partner in complex tasks (IT organizational planning)

**Growth Opportunity:** Experiment with more advanced prompt formats that include explicit instructions about reasoning steps or output structures using XML or JSON for highly specific requirements.

### 3. Feature & Tool Utilization
**Score: 3.5/5**

**Evidence:**
- Uses web search functionality to research current information (Claude Code features, Mendocino hiking)
- Leverages specialized tools like Claude Code for programming tasks
- Creates structured content with artifacts (task organization)
- Shows interest in exploring platform-specific capabilities (TODOs in Claude Code)

**Growth Opportunity:** Explore more multimodal capabilities by integrating image analysis, data visualization, or combining multiple tool functions in a single session.

### 4. Strategic vs Tactical Use
**Score: 4.5/5**

**Evidence:**
- Develops strategic frameworks (IT organizational restructuring, role definitions)
- Creates technical solutions (PowerShell scripts for system inventory)
- Uses AI for both immediate needs (editing communications) and long-term planning (IT annual plan)
- Applies AI to enhance decision-making (database connection analysis)

**Growth Opportunity:** Create an "AI transformation roadmap" for your team/organization that identifies 2-3 high-value processes where AI could fundamentally change approaches, not just optimize existing workflows.

### 5. Impact & Outcomes
**Score: 4/5**

**Evidence:**
- Producing business-critical documents (IT plans, role definitions)
- Creating technical solutions with direct implementation value (PowerShell scripts)
- Generating analysis that informs business decisions (database connection patterns)
- Developing comprehensive frameworks for organizational change

**Growth Opportunity:** Implement a measurement system to track time savings, quality improvements, or other metrics from your AI usage to quantify ROI and help build the case for expanded AI adoption.

### 6. Learning & Growth Mindset
**Score: 4/5**

**Evidence:**
- Actively researching AI improvements for business use (finance applications)
- Testing new capabilities (Claude Code, TODOs functionality)
- Creating learning resources for others (AI Task Force Newsletter)
- Asking questions about cost structures and capabilities

**Growth Opportunity:** Join an AI practitioner community (Anthropic's Discord, LinkedIn groups) to connect with peers working on similar AI integration challenges and share best practices.

## Overall Assessment

**AI Maturity Stage: Power Collaborator**

You're operating as a sophisticated AI user who leverages these tools strategically across both professional and personal domains. You show a clear understanding of how different AI tools can be applied to various problem types and have integrated them into your regular workflows. Your usage spans tactical problem-solving to strategic planning, demonstrating a mature approach to AI collaboration.

### Biggest Strengths This Week
1. **Strategic Application** - Using AI for comprehensive organizational planning and restructuring demonstrates high-level strategic thinking
2. **Technical Integration** - Combining AI with programming tasks (Claude Code, PowerShell) shows technical depth
3. **Knowledge Expansion** - Actively using AI to research and understand emerging capabilities (finance applications, tool features)

### Underused Opportunities
1. **Multimodal Inputs** - Limited evidence of working with images, charts, or other non-text inputs
2. **Collaborative Workflows** - Potential to expand sharing AI-generated content with team members for feedback/iteration
3. **Automation Sequences** - Opportunity to chain multiple AI interactions into streamlined workflows

### ONE Behavior Change for Biggest Improvement
**Implement systematic capability exploration** by dedicating 30 minutes weekly to testing one new feature or prompt technique you haven't tried before. Document these experiments to build your personal "AI playbook" of effective approaches.

### Practical Experiments for Next Week
1. **Try multi-step reasoning**: For your next complex analysis, explicitly ask Claude to break down its thinking process and show intermediate steps before reaching conclusions
2. **Create a decision framework**: Have Claude develop a structured framework for evaluating when to use different AI tools based on task characteristics
3. **Test memory capabilities**: Explore using past conversation search features to reference and build upon previous work
4. **Workflow integration**: Experiment with integrating Claude outputs directly into your professional tools through copy/paste, exports, or direct API connections
