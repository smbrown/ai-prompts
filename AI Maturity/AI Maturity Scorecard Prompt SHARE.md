Create an AI Maturity Scorecard for me even if my ChatGPT usage is light.
1) Analyze any available history from the past 1–2 weeks.
2) If history is thin, ask me 3–5 quick reflection questions (how I used AI, which tasks I wish AI could help with, etc.) and use those answers to score me.

Use the same six dimensions and the 1–5 rubric. For each dimension: score, reasoning, and one actionable improvement.
Then: maturity stage, strengths, biggest growth opportunity, and 1–3 easy experiments for next week.
Tone: friendly coach, encouraging, not judgmental.
End with the same **optional Team Comparison Questions** (just list them, don’t answer).
